// include/strata/kernels/lora.hpp - a LoRA adapter on the mixer's output projections: the engine's side of
// llama.cpp's `llama_adapter_lora` (`--lora` / `--lora-scaled`), for the two projections whose input is the
// mixer's output and whose output is the layer's residual write:
//
//   GDN layers:  ssm_out.weight       (ssm_value_dim -> n_embd)
//   QSA layers:  attn_output.weight   (n_head * head_dim -> n_embd)
//
// For layer l with an adapter there, the projection's output y = W x becomes
//
//   y <- y + s B (A x)        A = lora_a (rank x n_in), B = lora_b (n_out x rank), s = scale * alpha / rank
//
// exactly llama.cpp's `llm_build_lora_mm` (alpha 0: s = scale).  Several files are summed: their ranks are stacked,
// each B already multiplied by its own s.  A and B stay fp32 on every device that runs the layer (tens of MB), the
// products are fp32.  Off unless an adapter is loaded; a loaded one is switched per request through a device flag,
// so the captured graphs are the same either way.  With the flag off the projection's output is untouched: the
// result is bit-identical to the engine without an adapter.  The MTP draft layer never has one (it drafts; the
// verified tokens are the adapted model's).
